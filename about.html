        <p class="letter"> This extract suggests that physical circumstances might delimit the space in
            which life forms manifest.18 A quite different framing of Lebensform appears in
            German physiologist Karl Friedrich Burdach’s Die Physiologie als Erfahrungswissenschaft (Physiology as a Science of Practical Experience), from 1826 to 1840,
            in which Burdach writes, “The occurrence of new life forms is therefore not
            external, but is determined by inner life forces and grounded in life itself [Das
            Erscheinen neuer Lebensformen ist demnach kein äußerliches Hinzutreten,
            sondern von innen her bestimmt und im Leben selbst begründet].”19 Where
            the 1838 Jenaer Literatur-Zeitung quotation situates life forms in external physical conditions, Burdach’s phrasing posits life forms as self-organizing according to an inner principle.20 Burdach sought to render visible this principle by
            training his students at the Anatomical Institute in Königsberg in Goethe’s
            disciplined perception and morphology such that “living forms and their
            interconnections become evident in his [the student’s] soul.”21 Such vitalism,
            which first appeared around 1790, was one current in the German biology of
            the Romantic period</p>
